# g4tool

This is g4tool. And this README is not ready after years. Shame on me.

## Building

With GNU autoconf, just `sh bootstrap.sh`, configure and go.
You need Sam Leffler's `libtiff` in the standard search path.

## Todo

Further steps towards library access.
Every parametrisation must be done with nice shiny functions.

## Testfiles and Copyright

The document test files may be subject to copyrights or intellectual property
